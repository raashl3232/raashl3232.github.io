      <h3>We Welcome</h3>
      <div>
        “No matter who you are, or where you are on life’s journey, you are welcome here”.
        That’s how we begin each service, and how we live. It means everyone is equally
        invited to fully participate in the life of the church.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="triple">
      <h3>We Explore</h3>
      <div>
        We don’t profess to have all the answers. In fact, we encourage questioning.
        We cherish and respect the diversity of beliefs that enrich our life together.
        We are united, not by a common doctrine or creed, but by a commitment to living
        a life of love, compassion, and inclusion as taught by Jesus.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="triple">
      <h3>We Act</h3>
      <div>
        We are a hands-on, “get-it-done” church. While Sunday worship is an important part
        of our community, the real passion in our church is in our service to others. Our
        ministries are as varied as the needs within our world.

      <h3>All Are Welcome Here</h3>
      <div>
        As an Open and Affirming congregation, Webster UCC has embraced the vision of being a
        welcoming, Christ-centered community where all of God’s people are valued, supported
        and challenged to grow in faith and service. <br/> <br/> For us “all” truly means ALL. We feel
        you shouldn’t have to do any detective work to find out whether you will be welcome
        here. You are. Period. LGBTQ+? Yes. Person of Color? Yes. Living with a mental
        illness? Yes. Strong in your beliefs? Yes. Not sure what you believe? Yes. We
        are proud of the UCC’s inclusive tradition, and are committed to upholding that
        tradition. <br/> <br/> This affirmation extends not only to our programs and services, but also
        to sacraments, lay leadership positions, and the hiring of our staff, including clergy.
        You can read our inclusion statements <a href="#">here</a>.
